		<description><![CDATA[There is a production version of the WebSphere Liberty Profile available in our WebSphere 8.5.x product stream, the most recent level of that stream is 8.5.5.2.  

The content in this beta is the technologies the WebSphere development team is working on and we are looking for feedback from our users.  We don&#039;t have a specific timeline as to when all of these feature will be released, we are using an agile development and continuous delivery model to release our highest priority features to our clients as quickly as possible.

However, since you specifically asked about JCA, you can see from our latest announcement last week that we will be releasing the JCA support (along with several other features from the beta) as a new feature in our Liberty repository
 on June 13, 2014.  These features will be optionally installable on top of an 8.5.5.2 product level.
