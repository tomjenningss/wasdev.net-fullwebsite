		<description><![CDATA[Is the Websphere Application MIgration Toolkit only available for Rational Application Developer v9.0? Is there a previous version of the toolkit available (i.e. 3.5.0) to support application migration from v7 to v8.5.5 version to version migration on RAD 8.5.5?  I would like to use the tool but RAD 8.5.5 is on an older version of Eclipse 3.6.3. If this is not possible, are there any other source migration tools available for RAD? Thx]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, you can use the Migration Toolkit to migrate applications from WAS 6.1/7.0 to WAS V8.5. If you are asking about migrating WebSphere itself (and its configuration), all the tools you need come with WAS V8.5. You would use WASPreUpgrade and WASPostUpgrade to migrate your WebSphere profiles.

For the latest versions of the Migration Toolkit, go here:
https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/docs/migration/

For more information on WebSphere configuration migration, go here:
http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/wsbroker/redirect?version=phil&amp;product=was-nd-dist&amp;topic=tmig_tools

		<description><![CDATA[Since your question is about migrating from a WAS 8.5.5 profile to a WAS Liberty profile, I presume you are talking about the  WebSphere Application Server Migration Toolkit – Liberty Tech Preview tool. That tool analyzes your application, makes recommendations, and provides quick fixes where possible. It does not create a Liberty profile server.xml file.

Multiple migration tools are described in this announcement article, so if I made the wrong presumption please let me know. The only migration tool that updates a Liberty profile server.xml file is the &quot;Apache Tomcat to Liberty Profile Configuration Migration Tool&quot;. That is part of the Competitive Migration Tools that are also mentioned in this article.]]></description>
