		<description><![CDATA[Hello, 
You only need to deploy one pipeline per target environment (&#039;test&#039;, &#039;staging&#039;, etc). Each build runs as a pod dynamically created by the master, and load balanced by Kubernetes. Master does not bear much load, as almost all the work is delegated to the slaves. 

Regards,

		<description><![CDATA[for having 10 builds at the same time, then do I have to deploy 10 pods of mb pipeline? if we assume that every pods have a container.
I wonder how to calculate the number of pods for multiple build process

and how much a single master jenkins can afford the mb pipeline slave nodes?]]></description>
