		<description><![CDATA[Hi @Peter,  We are aware of this request for remote ejb workload mgmt, but it&#039;s not on our immediate development plans.  If this is important for your product plans, I would suggest voicing that opinion and voting on the RFE:

Thank you!

		<description><![CDATA[Remote EJB and workload management

Hello, as per http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/twlp_ejb_remote.html (Interoperability) the Liberty currently doesn&#039;t provide any form of workload management / failover capabilities for remote EJB operations. Since this is quite an important feature that would prevent us from proceeding with the potential migration to WAS Liberty in many of our customers environments I&#039;d like to ask:

- Are there any plans to implement the workload management / failover capabilities for remote EJB operations at all?
- If so, is it planned for some near future (like within a year or so)? I&#039;m not asking for any exact dates as I know that&#039;s something You can&#039;t actually comment on much, just if it&#039;s going to happen in the foreseeable future and not like in 5 years or so...

Thanks.]]></description>
