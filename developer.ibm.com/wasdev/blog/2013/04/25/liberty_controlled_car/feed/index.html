		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] The right question is not what can we do with it but rather who can benefit from it.Â I can hardly imagine a dozen of Agile developers with a Raspberry Pi in the middle of the room on which all the branches are kept. The Java Enterprise is scalable but with a resourse limit and without a clustering,Â only a partial capabilities can be used. For the hobbysts and juniors on the other hand, there are unlimited number of projects where a very portable, lightweight application server on a small board would be usedÂ includingÂ learning, testing, IoT and evenÂ driving a carÂ ?

		<description><![CDATA[Well the Arduino feature was only released a couple of weeks  ago, so it may not have been around in time for your current project. I&#039;ll make a note to reply here as soon as the code goes live - I have made it configurable so in theory you can make it work with the same hardware (raspberry pi with the adafruit pwm controller) with no code changes needed (cars can be configured via a webpage from the app). If you use a different PWM controller then you can replace the &quot;driver&quot; code in my app with something to work with your controller and as long as you maintain the API then the rest of the code will work with it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Tom.  Yeah I wish I had known about the Arduino feature earlier.  

I actually just saw the Hackathon (https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/2014/06/19/internet-things-hackathon-devoxx-uk) and told my self &quot;I wish I had known about the Arduino feature.&quot;  But at least now I know about it and can use it in future projects.

I was working on my own WiFi car when I came across this post.  That is why I am curious to see the code.  So no problem, but I would still like to see it when you post the code.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I saw your cool lizard project on a video podcast when someone retweeted it on Twitter. I think we tweeted a link to it from the account. It&#039;d be great to talk to you about it a bit - maybe interview you for WASdev.net. If you&#039;re interested/willing, drop us an email to wasdev@uk.ibm.com and I&#039;ll get in touch. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s really awesome!

I see you have created your own serial port listener code to read input from your Arduino sketch - it&#039;s a little late now to help but you should check out our new Arduino user feature (blog here: https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/2014/06/11/arduino-feature-liberty-profile/ sample here: https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/docs/getting-java-apps-talking-arduino/ ). This does a lot of the work you are already doing in regards to communicating with your Arduino (hence why it may be a little late as you&#039;ve already done the hard work of implementing the Liberty&gt;Arduino connection yourself) but it gives you some nice API options (remote method invocation of methods on your Arduino sketch, direct pin read/writes, callbacks based on pin inputs all from your web app) which may make it easier if you choose to add more Arduino sensors/functionality in the future.]]></description>

Can&#039;t give a date as it is still out of my hands but I was asked to change a dependency in the code to allow us to open source with a nicer license which has now been completed.]]></description>
