		<description><![CDATA[As you have probably spotted the latest Liberty profile does not have support for Java EE 7, but I&#039;m not allowed to talk about future product plans outside of an NDA. So for now there is no word I can share. If you are interested in Java EE 7, or specific bits of Java EE 7 such as WebSockets then you can go to the Request for Enhancements tool and vote for existing RFEs or submit new ones.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Those numbers were a bit surprising for me too. I haven&#039;t actually done anything more than install it yet, so I can&#039;t comment on my experience, but it&#039;s good to hear a lot of positive things about Liberty!

What&#039;s the word on Java EE 7 support?]]></description>
