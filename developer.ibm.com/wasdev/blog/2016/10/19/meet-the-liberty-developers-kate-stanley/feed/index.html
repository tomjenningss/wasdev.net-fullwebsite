		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Kate Stanley, software engineer at IBM UK, said that &#8220;the thing we haven&#8217;t seen before is we&#8217;re seeing more and more people iterate faster and deliver faster. It&#8217;s no longer a case of bring something new out every year. You need to bring out every week or every hour even. Maybe the complexity the system added wasn&#8217;t worth the reward that it got for me to move faster. Now the rewards are greater. So it&#8217;s worth taking on the complexity.&#8221; [&#8230;]]]></description>
