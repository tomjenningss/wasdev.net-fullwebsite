		<description><![CDATA[Hey Luigi,
Thanks for your feedback!  Unfortunately, as you noted, the annotation aggregation of this feature was only works when the resources are inside the same project.    If you want keep your project structure you could add a YAML or JSON Swagger file (static doc) to your WAR file, which would expose your APIs correctly.  You can do that by putting all the resources in a single project, grabbing the output from api/docs, then saving that in your WAR - then you can go back to the original structure.  

By the way, have you checked out the new MicroProfile OpenAPI feature?  https://openliberty.io/blog/2018/05/22/microprofile-openapi-intro.html

Thanks,
Arthur]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Arthur,
thanks a lot for your article, but I am not able to display the REST APIs doc following your tutorial.
My project is composed by an EAR and JAXRS REST APIs involves in 3 projects:
- War project with the web.xml file and JaxRs Application class with the method getSingletons that returns all resources.
- Java jar file with interfaces for rest resources. The interfaces contain the JAX-RS annotations
- Java jar file with the resource implementation, each class extends the interface
Seems that apiDiscovery is not able to detect the resources.
If I create only one project with all resources inside it, the APIs are discovered well and all, but I need to use the scenario below.
Thanks a lot for your help]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Alon.    What you did is correct.    I suspect that these errors are coming from other web modules that you have deployed in your same Liberty application server?     You can disable api discovery for specific modules by using the `webModuleDoc` element (see this page for an example that disables a particular web module: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/twlp_api_discovery.html)

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Arthur,
First of all thank you for your post. 
Second, when im trying to run my JVM server with the apiDiscovery feture that i included in my server.xml file, my CICS procedure facing a lot of Dumps and errors which disable the proper behavior of the system. 
Can you please tell me what do i need to implement before i enabled the apiDiscovery feature and what do i need to implement afterwards ? Because I think that i miss some step for making this work.. 
The things that i done : 
1. Enabled apiDiscovery feature in server.xml file.
2. Created Swagger.json file under the META-INF directory in my service project.
That&#039;s it.
Thak you very much.]]></description>

`@SwaggerDefinition(tags = { @Tag(name = &quot;AwesomeAPI&quot;, description = &quot;some description&quot;) })` to my Application class
and `@Api(tags={&quot;AwesomeAPI&quot;})` to all my resource classes and now everything is grouped nicely in &quot;AwesomeAPI&quot; group :)]]></description>

The most common issue is having duplicate method names within your jaxrs app (ie: same method in 2 different resources).   Do you have that?  Can you offer more information about your app? (how is it structured, how many resources, are you using web.xml or purely annotations, etc)]]></description>

I configured apiDiscovery but I don&#039;t see apis being discovered. I&#039;m using WebSphere Liberty 8.5.5.9. The logs aren&#039;t helping. Any pointers you can give?

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Rocky.  Unfortunately WAS 8.5.5.0 does not have any native Swagger support, as it started with Liberty 8.5.58 and 8.5.5.9.

However, you can integrate our open source &quot;offline swagger processor&quot; (https://github.com/WASdev/tool.swagger.docgen) into your build system to extract a Swagger definition (either JSON or YAML) from your applications, using the exact same logic as Liberty uses.

Thanks,

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Hans!  Be sure to check out the newest blog about this topic (with videos), at https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/blog/2016/04/13/deploying-swagger-enabled-endpoints-websphere-liberty-bluemix-api-connect/

At the moment we don&#039;t have a mechanism to automatically exclude runtime endpoints, such as the jmx connector, but that&#039;s definitely on our radar and being considered.

What you can do is take advantage of our multi-cardinality query param callled &quot;root&quot;.   So for example, if you have 2 apps, with corresponding context roots of /myApp1 and /myApp2, you can call &quot;/ibm/api/docs?root=/myApp1&amp;root=/myApp2&quot; and the Swagger 2.0 doc from that call will only contain those 2 apps, nothing else.

The exact same filtering is available in the UI side by using the filter input box, where you can type in &quot;/myApp1, /myApp2&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thats correct. But 2 services, with different context root can have the same api paths after the context. Such as /health
The explorer is then exposing them as &quot;health&quot; and &quot;health1&quot; which is kinda ugly.
I would guess we are not the only ones having an health endpoint in all of our services - therefor it would be quite awesome if the explorer would group services (contexts)!]]></description>

The two services couldn&#039;t have the same context root, by virtue of that not being allowed in a web container.

		<description><![CDATA[Hey,

(a) Because /ibm/api/docs is an aggregation of all the restful endpoints in that Liberty instance, we have logic that adds the basepath of the individual APIs into the path themselves, since likely not all APIs will share the same basepath.  Same goes for the version.  We have some improvements we are considering for the future, related to when you filter the docs into a specific app, by using the &quot;root&quot; query param (ie: /ibm/api/docs?root=/myApp)

(b) The grouping in the UI is based on the Swagger tags used.  So if you use a common tag with your resources they will be grouped together.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey,</p>
<p>(a) Because /ibm/api/docs is an aggregation of all the restful endpoints in that Liberty instance, we have logic that adds the basepath of the individual APIs into the path themselves, since likely not all APIs will share the same basepath.  Same goes for the version.  We have some improvements we are considering for the future, related to when you filter the docs into a specific app, by using the &#8220;root&#8221; query param (ie: /ibm/api/docs?root=/myApp)</p>
<p>(b) The grouping in the UI is based on the Swagger tags used.  So if you use a common tag with your resources they will be grouped together.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

The name &quot;default&quot; is used when the app doesn&#039;t contain any Swagger Tags.   You can add a tag (or more than 1) to your app by using the SwaggerDefinition annotation.  See an example here: https://github.com/WASdev/sample.swagger/blob/master/swagger-sample-application/src/main/java/net/wasdev/swaggersample/jaxrs/JAXRSApp.java

Then you have to reference that tag from a resource, by using the @API(&quot;tagname&quot;) annotation, as seen in https://github.com/WASdev/sample.swagger/blob/master/swagger-sample-application/src/main/java/net/wasdev/swaggersample/jaxrs/TasksResource.java

You could override each tag for a specific operation by using the @APIOperation annotation, http://docs.swagger.io/swagger-core/v1.5.0/apidocs/io/swagger/annotations/ApiOperation.html#tags()

Thanks,
Arthur]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I have this working fine for my app using (WebSphere Application Server 2016.3.0.0/wlp-1.0.12.20160305-0200).  Only question is how do I &#039;name&#039; my API for use in the explorer?  It shows up as &#039;default&#039;.

I thought that by &#039;default&#039;, it would be my context root... but I don&#039;t see any way to influence that?

Many thanks!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Arthur,
Thanks for the hint with @ApiOperation.nickname. Don&#039;t you think however that it is a bit awkward to expect methods name to be globally unique? Using fully qualified name instead would be more justified in my humble opinion.

The operation ID must be unique within your web module, which can be achieved by choosing unique method names for your JAXRS methods, or by using the ApiOperation annotation (http://docs.swagger.io/swagger-core/current/apidocs/index.html?io/swagger/annotations/ApiOperation.html), with its nickname attribute.

Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Arthur,
downloading beta that helps :) 

Now I have another issue:
io.swagger.models.SwaggerException: CWWKO1204E: Can not have multiple operations with the same operation ID: create

This is not a surprise as operationId is created based on method name and my application contains many webservices so the method name is not unique. Could you fix that or report that issue to the right people.

BR,
Adam]]></description>
