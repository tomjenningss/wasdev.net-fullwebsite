		<description><![CDATA[Hi ayoho,

We configured our websphere as OpenID connect RP. It generates a JsessionID as well as an WAS_* cookie (which I believe is the LTPA token). Is it possible to turn off LTPA cookie and rely solely on the JsessionId to identity the user session? Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What if I have an application that in some scenarios act as a RP, and in other scenarios act as a RS, can I configure liberty and openidconnect to support this? Or do I have to break my application up into several pieces with more distinct roles (RP vs RS)?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OpenID Connect and LTPA tokens are distinct single sign-on constructs in Liberty. They are both mechanisms used for granting access to protected resources, however they do not necessarily share any kind of interaction.

When authenticating to a Liberty server acting as an OpenID Provider (OP), an LTPA token is generated for that particular user to facilitate single sign-on with the OP. When authenticating to a Liberty server acting as an OpenID Connect Relying Party (RP), an LTPA token may be generated for subsequent request to the RP. However, that LTPA token (the one generated for the RP) behaves more like a session token and cannot be shared with other servers (the token is returned using a different cookie name and might have been generated using a different LTPA key which could render it useless to other servers).]]></description>
