		<description><![CDATA[It seems the latest version of the tooling has broken the RTC 6.0.6 plugin in Eclipse 2019-06. The compare window will no longer open. Even after unistalling the tooling the compare window still does not open.  Has anyone else encountered this?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It looks like the development tooling for Dojo has been dropped somewhere along the way.   
Our product still has a lot of Dojo and we would like to not fall behind with Eclipse versions.   Can we use a newer Eclipse (ex. Photon) with a version of the WDT that contains some Dojo smarts?  If so, what is the most recent WDT that still understands Dojo?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do WebSphere Developer Tools 8.0, etc, work anymore with Eclipse?  WebSphere 8.0 Developer Tools are available for multiple modern Eclipse versions, but you don&#039;t state anywhere that Eclipse Mars and above won&#039;t run on Java 1.6, but the instructions all say to point Eclipse.ini to the AppServer\java\bin folder.  But with WebSphere Development Tools 8.0, this folder has JRE 1.6.  Eclipse Mars/Neon/etc will NOT run on JRE 1.6 but you offer WebSphere Developer Tools 8.0 these Eclipse versions.  Can you please explain a workaround?  Your instructions state to set the IDE JRE to point to the IBM WAS JRE so they match, so the server can connect to Eclipse properly.  This seems impossible given the scenario above. I tried both my company&#039;s paid WAS 8.0 server and downloading the WAS developer server 8.0.  Both are JRE 1.6.]]></description>
