WebSphere V7 runs on Java SE 6.  However, WAS V7 is out of support. You should look at moving to Liberty or V8.5.5 or V9. Here is some useful migration information. https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27008724.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Martin, 
My apologies for missing your question. WAS 8.5.5.x started supporting Java 8 in version 8.5.5.9. So you would need to update your WAS V8.5.5.7 installation to V8.5.5.9, install Java 8, and use the managesdk command to switch your installation to use Java 8.  WAS v9 only supports Java 8.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Cindy,
is there a possibility to run WAS v8.5.6.x and WAS v9 with JDK v8? If so, what would I need to do if I have a RAD v9.5 with a WAS v8.5.5.7 installation to get that done?
Thanks much in advance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Doug, 
The link you provided is the correct link for the Eclipse migration tool.  Do you have the December 2015 version installed?  Do you not see this dialog at all, or are certain features not present on the dialog?  

To open this dialog from the Software Analyzer Configuration dialog, choose WebSphere Application Server Version Migration from the Rule Sets list.  Click Set...  You will only see the Java EE 7 Technologies check boxes if you have Liberty or Liberty Core as the target application server and Java EE 7 as your target Java EE version.

If this doesn&#039;t help, let me know the steps your are taking and what you see at each.

		<description><![CDATA[When I run the WebSphere Migration Tool in my Eclipse Juno environment (with Liberty profile) and a codebase that runs on WebSphere 8558 Full profile I don&#039;t see the options you mentioned above as selectable.  All the rules are already created and their is no choice to create a new rule. I am using the tool downloaded from: https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/#asset/tools-WebSphere_Application_Server_Migration_Toolkit

I saw a command line tool and this one, maybe there is a third tool?
