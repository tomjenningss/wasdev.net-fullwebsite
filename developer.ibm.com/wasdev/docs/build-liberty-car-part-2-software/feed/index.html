		<description><![CDATA[The car is running a WAS Liberty app server so getting remote access is the same as with any Java EE web app - if you connect the car to a router and give it a public IP address and/or setup port forwarding correctly then yes you could drive it from anywhere in the world. In fact Holly Cummins (one of the WAS Liberty developers) drove the car while it was in our UK lab live from a conference in Germany. The biggest problem when driving remotely comes as any video feed you have showing the car will add several seconds of latency when looking at long distances, which makes it harder to drive.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi - yes the project is in Java as it runs as a web application. The project was written from scratch so there is no Python version of the code I created for the web application - you can see the Java code from our Github account (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WASdev/skunkworks.libertycar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://github.com/WASdev/skunkworks.libertycar&lt;/a&gt;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the links to the roller - I&#039;ll go and have a look through it later today :)

As for security with the Liberty Cars it&#039;s very basic as we authenticate based on the IP address of the user. I do it that way as it&#039;s cheap and the cars are usually on their own isolated WiFi network which minimizes risk. My todo list does include adding basic role based security to the admin, config and driving pages which would be a proper security implementation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very cool, Tom!

Thanks for posting the code.  I can&#039;t wait to see how you did security.

I just posted documentation/video of the Java-powered mini Roller I have been making.  It is also controlled over WiFi.
