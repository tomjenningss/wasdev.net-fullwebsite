You would create a WAR for WebSphere in a similar fashion as you did for Tomcat. Are you using Maven?  An IDE?  A Java EE compliant WAR should also deploy to Liberty.  What errors are you seeing?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello,
I want to migrate some applications from was855 to libertycore.
I just want to have the list of all severe rules checked for the migration.
When generating the report, we can only have the rules representing a risk for the migration but we also need the rules witch are checked and verified (even if they don&#039;t represent a risk ).
This is actually important for the migration we are trying to accomplish.

Many thanks
Khaled]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The WebSphere Migration Knowledge Collection (z/OS tab) (https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27010819) is a great place to start. It contains z/OS migration information and links to the knowledge center.  Also, see the other pages in the knowledge collection - it is all about migration.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Prabhu, 
Try running the WASMigrationAppInstaller command which will find in the bin directory of the new profile you created. Point the command to the migration backup directory used by WASPostUpgrade. That command will try to redeploy all the applications that are not currently deployed and should print out messages for each app saying if it was deployed or possibly an error if not.

Here is the command help:
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.migration.base.doc/ae/rmig_WASMigrationAppInstaller.html

If you need more help after that, open a support ticket for quicker assistance.

Thanks,
Cindy]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You will need to look at the logs and trace and see what it is telling you.   There are many reasons why the application fails to deploy.
The Knowledge Center contains instructions on how to retry deploying failed applications.  You can then isolate the deployment issue.
Without the logs, I would just be guessing as to why your applications did not deploy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As of WebSphere v7 released in 2008, the Version-to-Version Configuration Migration Tools (WASPreUpgrade and WASPostUpgrade) no longer support WebSphere V5.0 and earlier versions.  See page two of the WebSphere Application Server v7 Migration Guide, &quot;Automatic migration utilities no longer support WebSphere V5.0 as an originating system version&quot; --&#062; http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp4635.pdf

In theory, you could use the configuration migration tools to migrate to WebSphere v6.1. Then, from WebSphere v6.1, perform a remote migration to WebSphere v8.5.5. However, WebSphere v6.1 is out of service and no longer supported. If any problems were encountered with the WebSphere v6.1 migration you would not be able to get any support or bug fixes. Additionally, performing intermediate migrations can be very time consuming due to having to work through various technical issues as you migrate to each version, and also performing all testing twice. If you skipped thorough testing on the intermediate install, you would not be able to track if a problem was introduced by the first or second migration. Instead the recommendation would be to start with a fresh WebSphere v8.5.5 install and configure all necessary settings such as security, shared libraries, and database resources by hand. Then port your applications into this environment one at a time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Cindy,

   I am interested in migrating an app from t WAS to liberty WAS. I have tried reading the posts and watching the videos and got no where very fast.
 
   Is there a tutorial where an app is migrated and all the eclipse and tools steps are described slowly and
clearly , so that a non expert in the art can benefit?

  Your migration video between was versions, eg was 80 to liberty went so fast especially in the section of
downloading the tools from wasdev.net. Your screen shot in the video is different from the current wasdev.net page.

Thanks
Thanks]]></description>
