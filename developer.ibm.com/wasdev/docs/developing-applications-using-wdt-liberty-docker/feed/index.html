		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I&#039;m working on a project where I&#039;m dockerizing an existing application, the docker container is running just fine. Now I&#039;m working on setting up my eclipse workspace with WDT and that&#039;s where I&#039;m facing issues.

I&#039;ve been following the instructions on this page, I&#039;m able to create the server in eclipse and then add my existing project using &quot;Add and Remove&quot;, the application is added to the &quot;server.xml&quot; but all I can see in the &quot;Liberty Runtime (application name)&quot; directory is a file being created as application.war.xml inside &quot;servers/defaultServer/apps&quot; with content as:




And that&#039;s all, I was expecting to see a folder &quot;expanded&quot; and all my files in there but its not being created. I should be missing some steps, hopefully you can help me out.

Thank you]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve tried the steps multiple time, but there&#039;s no consistency on when eclipse see the containers running when it&#039;s time to choose what container is running liberty just as described in step 5. Please can you provide some more insight on how to do that.]]></description>
