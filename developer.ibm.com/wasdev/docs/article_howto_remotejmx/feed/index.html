		<description><![CDATA[Hey Chris - thanks for trying out the blog.  I will be happy to help out.  The pre-requisite for running the code in the Java client section is:
(1) create a Java project (ie: in Eclipse, or favorite IDE)
(2) add the restConnector.jar into your project&#039;s classpath (this jar can be copied from your Liberty&#039;s installation, inside the wlp/clients folder
(3) if you are just doing development / test, you can also copy the server&#039;s keystore file from the running target Liberty server (with the server.xml specified in the top of the blog), which is located at &lt;server&gt;/resources/security/key.jks and use that as your Java client&#039;s truststore (this is what you point to as the value of the &quot;javax.net.ssl.trustStore&quot; key in the hashmap, with the corresponding password, which is setup in your &quot;keystore&quot; element in server.xml&quot;
--- please note that you would not do this approach for production: in that scenario you should use the appropriate Java keystore tools to extra a truststore for your client.
(4) Copy the code in that section into your Java program/app, making sure you put the right values for the truststore location/password (from 3), and the host/port of the target Liberty server you&#039;re connecting to.
(5) Use your mbsc object to interact with the remote server (see this interface: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/management/MBeanServerConnection.html)

Let me know if I can help clarify any of the steps.  

Thanks,
Arthur]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Raj,

I assume this is connecting via JConsole.  If so, include the flag &quot;-debug&quot; in your java invocation to start JConsole and you should see any errors that are causing your connection to fail.

Thanks,
Arthur]]></description>

Am trying these steps, but connection to DSI server keeps failing with error -

connection to tester@service:jmx:rest://localhost:9443/IBMJMXConnectorREST did not succeed. Would you like to try again?

Thanks
