		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been having continuous issues installing the IBM Java EE Batch tools as described at the start of this tutorial. I am able to install the websphere developer tools and see the &#039;Install Websphere Software&#039; option in the help menu in eclipse, but upon clicking it I get the following error:

The WebSphere software catalog server is not available

This is the session data:

eclipse.buildId=4.11.0.I20190307-0500
java.version=1.8.0_211
java.vendor=Oracle Corporation
BootLoader constants: OS=win32, ARCH=x86_64, WS=win32, NL=en_US
Framework arguments:  -product org.eclipse.epp.package.jee.product

The only result relating to this suggests it could be a proxy / connectivity issue, but I was able to download and install the wdt through the eclipse marketplace so I do not believe this is the issue. I could try to install RAD and move forward with that - as I believe it already provides the utilities I am attempting to install - but can anyone recommend a way to resolve this? Alternatively can you point me in the direction of a tutorial moving forward without these tools?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not able to see &quot;Create Java EE Batch Project&quot;
I have Neon.3 and I&#039;ve just installed WAS Liberty with Java EE Full Platform so now I have WebSphere Application Server Developer Tools for Eclipse Version: 17.0.0.1 Build id: 20170227_1658

While I&#039;am able to add batch feature to Liberty Server I didn&#039;t see any option to create a Java EE Batch project. If I get featureList by featureManager batch-1.0 is present.

I&#039;ve also created a new Liberty Server  with Batch Managment included but with the same results.

Any Idea?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have managed to get this application to work in WebSphere Application Server v9.0 Traditional with the default in-memory Job Repository. However this was from the following Github link https://github.com/WASdev/sample.javaee7.sleepybatchlet. In the README.md, it eludes that one can also run this with a file-based Derby datasource in WebSphere Application server Classic (no version was mentioned). This is done by creating a Derby datasource and setting up 2 custom JVM properties in the server that is housing the application. These were com.ibm.ws.batch.DB_SCHEMA=BATCH and com.ibm.ws.batch.JNDI_NAME=. Has anyone managed to do this and on what version of WebSpehere Application. We have raised a PMR, but was informed that on v9.0 Traditional only supports in-memory Job Repository.
Any help on these custom properties will be helpful as they do not seem to create the tables in the Derby database, nor raises any errors on the SystemOut.log.
Thanks in advance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have a problem with the submitter user credentials not being used for the batch jobs. 
I have followed IBM instructions exactly which are detailed here &quot;https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tgrid_bgcred.html&quot;
When I check the files created I can see it was created with the server credentials and not the submitter credentials. Also displaying the user credentials displays the server user name and not submitter name. Although within the JMC console it shows the correct user account for the submitter.
Does anyone else have the same issue with WAS 8.5.5.8 ?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jie,

Sorry for the slow response.

Not sure what questions you had relating to the database configuration for the &quot;job repository&quot; the persistent store used by the batch runtime.   The many ways to configure the underlying data source certainly result in a variety of config options.   As far as the tables themselves, in these simple development scenarios you won&#039;t see many of the details since the tables will just be auto-created.   There is an ability to generate the DDL if that&#039;s what you&#039;re looking for.

From another angle, we do have another &quot;BonusPayout&quot; sample at:
https://github.com/WASdev/sample.batch.bonuspayout
though the job repository isn&#039;t configured all that differently.
This sample is a bit more interesting and shows how to integrate with Maven and WDT as well.

In any case, please feel free to ask any follow-up question in our forum at:
https://developer.ibm.com/answers/
with a tag of &quot;Batch&quot; and/or one of the WebSphere App Server tags.

Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chandra,

Sorry for the delayed response.  Just wanted to acknowledge your comment and reply that no, there is no unsecured option at present.   

On the other hand, you do NOT have to define batch roles (submitter, monitor, admin), as explained here:
https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSD28V_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/twlp_batch_securing.html

But you do need to authenticate to use the REST API providing the bridge between WDT and the server.]]></description>

One question abt the example , I see there is a Configuration of  batch persistence for derby, but seems that the example didn&#039;t show the details of the manipulation of DB. Is there any more examples for the Batch job with DB?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello gkb, 
  the Job Scheduling is available through the out-of-the-box integration with IBM Workload Scheduler (also known as TWS). IBM Workload Scheduler includes a job adapter based on JSR-352 specification, that can connect to the Liberty batch container to kickoff and track Java jobs running within the container.
Thanks to such integration you can not only schedule Jobs running within Liberty, but you can also orchestrate complex processes containing other steps like file transfer, shell script, RDBMS actions, etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Note there are a variety of ways to install the batchManagement-1.0 feature into your server, as there are a variety of ways to install the Liberty profile. 

If you&#039;re downloading the Liberty server from Eclipse/WDT, from some either the Servers or Runtime Explorer view perhaps, you can get this batchManagement-1.0 by selecting the &quot;Base Bundle&quot;.  In more detail, choose &quot;Install from an archive or repository&quot; =&gt; &quot;Download and install a new runtime environment from ibm.com&quot;, then selecting something like &quot;WAS Liberty V8.5.5.7 Kernel&quot; then on the &quot;Install Additional Content&quot; wizard page select the &quot;Base Bundle&quot;.

If you&#039;ve already got Liberty or have downloaded it from outside of WDT, you can add batchManagement-1.0 by something like: 

 ./wlp/bin/installUtility install batchManagement-1.0 

Hope that helps.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jie, 
Did you check that your Liberty server has the batchManagement-1.0 feature installed? You can use this command to list the installed features: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/was_beta_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/rwlp_command_featuremanager.html

If I remember correctly, that feature is not installed by default.]]></description>
