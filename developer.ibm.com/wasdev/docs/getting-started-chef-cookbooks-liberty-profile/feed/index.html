		<description><![CDATA[Can I do configuration management for WAS ND 7/8/liberty profile using Chef ? By Configuration management what I mean is for ex: WAS ND 7, would I be able to write a recipe which will create/modify/delete JDBC data source/JMS Topic/Queue, Share library, Users modifications etc on a WAS ND 7 instance without using Jython/JACL or any other scripts. The point is update run time configurations for a product solely using Chef recipe or Chef + Docker, if its possible kindly let me know how.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you. That worked out great. I now have a Chef provisioned, Vagrant box with Websphere Liberty installed and running. 

There is one minor change I had to make under &#039;Configure and bring up VirtualBox using Vagrant&#039;. I executed &#039;vagrant init hashicorp/precise64&#039; to create my vagrant file. Later, when I executed &#039;knife node list&#039;, I noticed that my node was named &#039;precise64&#039; rather than &#039;-starter&#039;. I used precise64 in the JSON text and proceeded with the rest of the steps successfully.

Is there a different vagrant box you would recommend for this?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I see the real problem now. There&#039;s a bug in our JSPExamples.rb file above. We were using:
&lt;code&gt;
  owner &quot;wlp&quot;
  group &quot;wlp-admin&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
Elsewhere the default group is created which is now wlpadmin rather than wlp-admin. It would be safer to use:
&lt;code&gt;
  owner node[:wlp][:user]
  group node[:wlp][:group]
&lt;/code&gt;
I&#039;ll get the article changed. Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you. I changed the port forwarding line to config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 9080, host: 9090 and I could not access localhost:9090. I tried with different ports higher than 9999 and I still cannot get port forwarding to work. I actually have another Vagrant box where I was able to forward port 3030 (dashing.io) and a non Vagrant box with port 8080 (Jenkins). They were not running when I was running the VM with WAS Liberty.

I gave up on the port forwarding and followed every step of this blogpost. I am stuck at sudo chef-client. The only thing different in my chef-repo is the version if ibm java (ibm-java-x86_64-sdk-7.1-2.10.bin). I entered the installer&#039;s name correctly in the node configuration (knife node edit NODE). 

The VM console has this error message when I executed sudo chef-client.

		<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re using the wrong port when viewing from the host. The instructions above say:

Edit the Vagrantfile configuration file in the chef-repo directory and change 8080 to 9080 on the line:

&lt;code&gt;config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 8080, host: 9090&lt;/code&gt;

so you should end up with
&lt;code&gt;config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 9080, host: 9090&lt;/code&gt;

Then when you hit localhost:9090 it should work.]]></description>
