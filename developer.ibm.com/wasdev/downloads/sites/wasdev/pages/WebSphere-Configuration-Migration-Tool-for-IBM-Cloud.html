<h1>WebSphere Configuration Migration Tool for IBM Cloud</h1>
<div id="description">
<div id="ibm-wasdev-feature-desc-content">
  <p><strong>Supports migrating to IBM Cloud (public), to IBM Cloud Private, and now to Docker.</strong></p>

  <p>The tool allows you to select from one of two wizards. The "Virtual Machine" wizard allows you to migrate your on-premises WebSphere cell, server or application to virtual machines running in the IBM Cloud (public or private). The "Container" wizard allows you to migrate an application from a WebSphere cell into its own standalone server running in a Docker container by generating the necessary Docker build artifacts.</p>

  <p>For public IBM Cloud, you will need an IBM Cloud account with access to the WebSphere Application Server service. For IBM Cloud Private, contact the administrator of your company's installation to set up proper access to the WebSphere Application Server VM Quickstarter service.</p>

  <p>When starting the "Virtual Machine" wizard, you are given a high-level overview of the entire on-premises to IBM Cloud migration process, which consists of two main phases:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Creating and assigning a WebSphere service instance to handle the uploaded configuration data from the selected on-premises WebSphere Cell.</li>
    <li>Provisioning the virtual machines, which includes the migration of the uploaded configuration data assigned to the service instance.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Phase 1 of the process is handled by the easy to use "Virtual Machine" wizard which guides you through the 6 steps. The last step of phase 1 provides a link to the provisioning page for the assigned service instance. Using this link, you will kick off phase 2 which provisions a virtual machine for each node in the cell. Provisioning also includes the migration of the node’s configuration data.</p>

  <p>When starting the "Container" wizard you are also given a high-level overview of the migration process, which consists of two main phases:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Selecting an application from your WebSphere cell and generate the Docker build artifacts.</li>
    <li>Modify the artifacts, build the Docker image and publish it.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Docker migrations only support migrating into a standalone server. It does not support migrating a full Network Deployment cell. During the Docker build process the application and its associated configuration data is extracted from the old WebSphere cell and migrated into the standalone server.</p>

  <p>The applicaiton selective migration feature used by the Docker migration process is also available for IBM Cloud migrations. The IBM Cloud migration process also allows you to selective migrate a single server and its applications from a Network Deployment cell into its own standalone server.</p>

  <p>Only WebSphere v9 is available when you migrate to the IBM Cloud or to Docker. Both wizards allow you to migrate from WebSphere release v7, v8, v855 or even WebSphere v9. They utilizes the “cloning” migration process that was delivered as part of WebSphere v9. “Cloning” allows your on-premises WebSphere cell to continue running both during and after the cell has been migrated to the IBM Cloud. Once the migration completes, both the old and new cells are independent and can run concurrently.</p>

  <p>Avoid the hassles of hardware and software management by cloning your WebSphere cell to the IBM Cloud. Use it to preview how your applications perform under WebSphere v9. Or to see how to tune your configuration for v9. Use it to practice and work out your future on-premises migration process. Provide a clone for a development team to test out their applications under v9. Clone once, clone many, use it for a short time, or for as long as you need. This tool makes it easier to achieve your WebSphere v9 goals.</p>

<h2 id="ibm-wasdev-feature-instructions-title">Installation</h2>
<div id="ibm-wasdev-feature-instructions-content">
  <ol>
    <li>Download the WebSphere Configuration Migration Tool for IBM Cloud by clicking Download.</li>
    <li>Extract the file into a new directory.</li>
    <li>
      Be sure the PATH environment variable is set correctly. <br />Example on Windows:
      <code>
        set PATH=c:\java\bin;%PATH%
      </code>
      Example on Mac/Linux:
      <code>
        export PATH=/java8/bin:$PATH
      </code>
    </li>
    <li>
      To start the wizard run this command from the directory containing CloudMigration.jar:
      <code>java -jar CloudMigration.jar</code>
    </li>
  </ol>
