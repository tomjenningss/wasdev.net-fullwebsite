If I make Java changes, stop the server and start it again, my changes are not getting reflected the first time. But it is working from the second time if I launch the application again. Latest code changes are used only from the second launch.

Am I missing any configuration? TIA.]]></description>

I&#039;ve been following the instructions on this page, I&#039;m able to create the server in eclipse and then add my existing project using &quot;Add and Remove&quot;, the application is added to the &quot;server.xml&quot; but all I can see in the &quot;Liberty Runtime (application name)&quot; directory is a file being created as application.war.xml inside &quot;servers/defaultServer/apps&quot; with content as:




And that&#039;s all, I was expecting to see a folder &quot;expanded&quot; and all my files in there but its not being created. I should be missing some steps, hopefully you can help me out.

Thank you]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been having continuous issues installing the IBM Java EE Batch tools as described at the start of this tutorial. I am able to install the websphere developer tools and see the &#039;Install Websphere Software&#039; option in the help menu in eclipse, but upon clicking it I get the following error:

The WebSphere software catalog server is not available

This is the session data:

eclipse.buildId=4.11.0.I20190307-0500
java.version=1.8.0_211
java.vendor=Oracle Corporation
BootLoader constants: OS=win32, ARCH=x86_64, WS=win32, NL=en_US
Framework arguments:  -product org.eclipse.epp.package.jee.product

The only result relating to this suggests it could be a proxy / connectivity issue, but I was able to download and install the wdt through the eclipse marketplace so I do not believe this is the issue. I could try to install RAD and move forward with that - as I believe it already provides the utilities I am attempting to install - but can anyone recommend a way to resolve this? Alternatively can you point me in the direction of a tutorial moving forward without these tools?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mario, 

Server tools does not support JDK version higher than 8.

If the you really want to use JDK 11 to start Eclipse, the only workaround I can think of is to set the &quot;Installed JRE&quot; in Eclipse to use JDK8. 

Window -&#062; Preference -&#062; Java -&#062; Installed JREs -&#062;add JDK8 and select the checkbox, then click &quot;Apply&quot;


 I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any workaround other than that. 

Thanks, 
Stephanie]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello,
I want to migrate some applications from was855 to libertycore.
I just want to have the list of all severe rules checked for the migration.
When generating the report, we can only have the rules representing a risk for the migration but we also need the rules witch are checked and verified (even if they don&#039;t represent a risk ).
This is actually important for the migration we are trying to accomplish.

Many thanks
Khaled]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your question.  I don&#039;t know when the function will be generally available (GA), but in Open Liberty, we&#039;re working on updating the current beta version of this function to make use of newer APIs, hopefully for a new beta this summer with a potential GA some time after that.  Once it GAs in Open Liberty, since the IBM Liberty editions are all based on Open Liberty, it could GA in IBM Liberty ND sometime afterwards.  Until that time, since the function is available in beta, you can use the beta image with a copy of the production server.xml and validate the connecition using the beta server.  You could also extract the datasources into a server config snippet and include that in both the beta and the production server to allow them to share the same config.]]></description>

Regarding: https://developer.ibm.com/articles/dm-1602-db2-docker-trs/

Until today it&#039;s not possible with Docker Swarm to use extra parameters like them.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Prabhu, 
Try running the WASMigrationAppInstaller command which will find in the bin directory of the new profile you created. Point the command to the migration backup directory used by WASPostUpgrade. That command will try to redeploy all the applications that are not currently deployed and should print out messages for each app saying if it was deployed or possibly an error if not.

Here is the command help:
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.migration.base.doc/ae/rmig_WASMigrationAppInstaller.html

If you need more help after that, open a support ticket for quicker assistance.

Thanks,

		<description><![CDATA[@Bobby, you can use the interruptHungRequests attribute in the requestTiming element to indicate that you want the server to try to terminate a request when it is determined to be hung.  See details in https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/rwlp_requesttiming.html . 

For example, to have the requestTiming feature attempt to abort the Arm10Servlet when it takes over 20s to run: 

&lt;requestTiming slowRequestThreshold=&quot;10s&quot; hungRequestThreshold=&quot;10m&quot;&gt;
  &lt;servletTiming servletName=&quot;Arm10Servlet&quot; hungRequestThreshold=”20s” interruptHungRequests=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;servletTiming appName=&quot;SecurityExchangeApp” hungRequestThreshold=”2h”/&gt;
&lt;/requestTiming&gt;]]></description>

I would advise you to run the tool with Java 7. Currently, we support the &quot;--analyze&quot;, &quot;--evaluate&quot;, and &quot;--inventory&quot; options with Java 6. However, the &quot;--featureList&quot; option is not supported with Java 6. 

If you are unable to run with Java 7, you can run the supported options separately with Java 6.

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Luigi,
Thanks for your feedback!  Unfortunately, as you noted, the annotation aggregation of this feature was only works when the resources are inside the same project.    If you want keep your project structure you could add a YAML or JSON Swagger file (static doc) to your WAR file, which would expose your APIs correctly.  You can do that by putting all the resources in a single project, grabbing the output from api/docs, then saving that in your WAR - then you can go back to the original structure.  

By the way, have you checked out the new MicroProfile OpenAPI feature?  https://openliberty.io/blog/2018/05/22/microprofile-openapi-intro.html

Thanks,
Arthur]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Arthur,
thanks a lot for your article, but I am not able to display the REST APIs doc following your tutorial.
My project is composed by an EAR and JAXRS REST APIs involves in 3 projects:
- War project with the web.xml file and JaxRs Application class with the method getSingletons that returns all resources.
- Java jar file with interfaces for rest resources. The interfaces contain the JAX-RS annotations
- Java jar file with the resource implementation, each class extends the interface
Seems that apiDiscovery is not able to detect the resources.
If I create only one project with all resources inside it, the APIs are discovered well and all, but I need to use the scenario below.
Thanks a lot for your help]]></description>
